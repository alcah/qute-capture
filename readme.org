#+TITLE:qute-org
Qutebrowser userscript for filing the current webpage into an org-mode file

* Implemented
 - Insert plain entries with page title and url under an arbitrary heading
 - Select an existing entry using dmenu and jump to that page
 - Some extra cli capabilities
 - Basic regexp filtering -- Display only those entries which contain a URL

* Planned
 - Delete entries from within Qutebrowser
 - Collect some additional information about the page such as the date accessed

* Non-features
 - A complete interface to org-mode in Qutebrowser. My only use for
   this script is to unify bookmarks and my org lists.

* Use & Installation
 - Place this script in the =~/.local/share/qutebrowser/userscripts= folder.
 - To create a new entry: =qute-org write=
 - To jump to an entry: =qute-org read=
 - Additional setting for org-file and subheading can be found within the script

* Dependencies
 - PyOrgMode -- The current version in pip is broken, you'll need to get it from git.

* Acknowledgements
 - Qutebrowser, for being just about the only usable modern browser
 - qute-pass, from which I shamelessly copied chunks of code
