#+TITLE:qute-org
Qutebrowser userscript for filing the current webpage into an org-mode file

* Implemented
 - Insert plain entries with page title and url under an arbitrary heading
 - Select an existing entry using dmenu and jump to that page
 - Basic regexp filtering -- Display only those entries which contain a URL
 - Collect any selected text and the date visited
 - Some cli capabilities

* Planned
 - The current version is feature complete

* Non-features
 - A complete interface to org-mode in Qutebrowser -- My only use for
   this script is to unify bookmarks and my org lists.
 - A complete parser for bookmarkish data -- Org is extremely free
   form, this is a great strength, but it means that some imposed
   structure must be accepted from non-interactive tools. Trying to
   accommodate every possible format a user might desire is
   impossible.

* Use & Installation
 - Place this script in the =~/.local/share/qutebrowser/userscripts= folder.
 - The default file+heading is =~/read-later.org+Read Later=
 - To create a new entry: =qute-org write=
 - To jump to an entry: =qute-org read=
 - To delete an entry: =qute-org rm=
 - See the source for additional settings

* Dependencies
 - PyOrgMode -- I recommend getting it from github, rather than pip
 - Dmenu

* Acknowledgements
 - Qutebrowser, for being just about the only usable modern browser
 - qute-pass, from which I shamelessly copied chunks of code
